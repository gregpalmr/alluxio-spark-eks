### Launch the Alluxio data platform and Spark on Amazon EKS.

---

## INTRODUCTION

The Alluxio high performance data platform allows compute workloads to run faster by caching remote data locally and by providing a unified namespace to mix disparate storage providers in the same data path. Alluxio helps:

- Improve performance of data analytics and AI/ML workloads by caching S3 bucket objects on fast, local NVMe storage.
- Reduces cloud storage data egress costs (from multiple regions) by reducing the number of repedative reads agsint S3 buckets.
- Helps reduce cloud storage API costs by caching metadata locally and reducing the number of API calls to the REST API.

This git repo provides a complete environment for demonstrating how to deploy Alluxio and Spark on an Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster using S3 as the persistent object store.

For more information on running Spark on EKS, see: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-emr-on-eks-job-submission-with-spark-operator-and-spark-submit/

## USAGE (con't)

## Step 5. Deploy run test Spark jobs against Alluxio

Reference the Alluxio documentation page on running Spark jobs against Alluxio.

TBD - Add some example SparkSQL and Pyspark jobs here.
